# Forking to Sous Chefs

Where it is not possible to contact the existing owner and transfer ownership to the sous-chefs.

You should rename using the following naming schema:
- Cookbook: `mongodb` --> `sc_mongodb` as per [RFC-78](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc078-supermarket-prefix.md)
- Repository: `mongodb`


# Adoption

If adopting an existing cookbook you must use the current name to carry on support for the existing user base.
In this case please see [cookbook transferring](https://github.com/sous-chefs/meta/blob/master/transfering-a-cookbook.md)
