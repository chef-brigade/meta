## Owners

Folks with complete control over the sous-chefs organization. This currently consists of cookbook maintainers.

## Chef de partie

Folks with commit access to sous-chefs repos. This is currently available to anyone who asks. Keep in mind, maintainers determine the commit policy for their own cookbooks, so belonging to this does not necessarily mean you should push commits to existing cookbooks.

## Commis

Folks who agree to the decisions made by the sous-chefs in [meta](https://github.com/sous-chefs/meta). Yeah, it doesn't really give any power, but it's a way of showing support for the sous-chefs.
